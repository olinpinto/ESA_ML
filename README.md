A Simple WIP Preprocessor and ML Script for CMS Run 2 Data

This repository includes all the necessary modules for preprocessing, ML-based model training, and fitting, along with some analytical and plotting functionalities, as well as a trained model and two baseline scripts. Please note that this is a work-in-progress (WIP) project; therefore, the code and supporting dependencies (which are yet to be listed) are still unrefined.
